# automatic_attendence_marker_teams

This simple script do the manual work of typing attendence on time and also exiting the meeting
(Doesn't mean you should'nt be studying , it's just to save time and made for learning purpose)

currently have two modes , zen and normal

everything is automatic in zen and in normal you can edit the details yourself

it is based on dom manipulation , selcting elements and button and using settimeout to trigger on specific time

Still in testing so not responsible.
